# TMdB Data Scraper
> Description: a program that allows to generate lists of movies from TMdB (or load from a JSON file) and do operations with them.
### Capabilities
- Compare **user rating** against **TMdB rating**.
- Compare **budget** against **TMdB rating**. 
- Get distribution of **directors** across list of movies.
- Get distribution of **actors** appearances across list of movies. 
- Compare **TMdD rating** against **movie profit**. 
- Order movies from oldest to newest. 
- Compare **runtime** against **age of the movie**.
- Get distribution of movies by **year**.
### Usage
1. Run project_cli.py
2. Either load from a JSON file (F) or from API (G)
3. Follow commands to display data (see _Capabilities_ section)
## Important notes
- **_Plot user rating against TMdB rating_** only works when list is generated with **_Get rated movies from TMdB account (R)_**, or when a json file generated by this command is opened. And because the way the API works, this only works with the movies I have rated from my own TMdB account.
- Some movies appear as without a budget or box office in the API responses, so they are generally excluded from plots and calculations. However, the following data visualization options do include them:
  - Graph distribution of directors.
  - Graph distribution of actors.
  - Order movies from oldest to newest.
  - Plot runtime against age of the movie.
  - Graph distribution of movies by year.
